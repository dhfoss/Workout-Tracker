### Description
fast-shore-14617.herokuapp.com/  
Welcome to my Workout Tracker app.  This allows you to keep a log of current and previous workouts.  It will store information on each individual workout such as reps and durations.  Information from past seven workouts are totaled up, and displayed on the stats page, so you can track your progress on the road to getting swole. 

### Installation
Nothing to install! Just visit the link provided above!

### Usage
When the user first clicks on the page, they will be displayed with the details from their latest workout automatically

To add on an exercise to the current workout, click "Continue Workout", and to start a new workout, click "New Workout". Either way, the user is taken to the add exercise page, where they can add either a cardio exercise, or a resistance exercise.  
![Add Exercise](/screen-shots/2-add-exercise.png?raw=true "Add Exercise")  

If "Complete Exercise" is clicked, the user is taken back to the homepage.  If "Add Exercise" is clicked, the current exercise is added, and the user has the chance to add another one.

If "Dashboard" is clicked, the user is taken to a stats page.  This totals up the duration and weight of all the past seven exercises.
